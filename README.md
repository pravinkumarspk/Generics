# ListArray â€“ Lite version of ArrayList

So... I was just doomscrolling on YouTube when I saw this video about **Generics**.  
Honestly, I didnâ€™t even know that `List`, `Stack`, `Queue` (the ones Iâ€™ve been using forever) actually come under generics.  

That got me curious, and I started learning about it â€” and wow, it actually became super interesting!  
So I ended up making my own **ArrayList Lite version**, called `ListArray` (LOL).

It basically does the same stuff as `ArrayList` but in my own way.  
I used a plain array underneath and wrote the logic for:

- `add` (with and without index)
- `remove`
- `get`
- `size`
- `sort`
- `clear`
- `isEmpty`

And every time the array gets full, I literally copy it and make it double in size â€” just like the real thing does behind the scenes.

## Points
- **Motive of this project** â€“ to explore and understand how ArrayList works internally  
- **Learned Generics** â€“ how to create a class with `<T>` and use it for any data type  
- **Working of Generics** â€“ type safety, reusability, and avoiding casting everywhere  
- **Understanding of Generics** â€“ why they exist and how powerful they are for collections

I really enjoyed doing this project.  
Special thanks to **Code with John** who randomly popped up in my YouTube suggestions and started this whole rabbit hole. ðŸ˜…  

This was fun. Learned a lot.
